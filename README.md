# food_recommendation
This program can give you a restaurant recommendation based on a restaurant you already like. It does this by finding places that got good reviews from reviewers who rated a restaurant you love highly.

Instructions:
1) Set up requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
2) To run: python food_rec.py
The program will prompt you to provide it with a Yelp URL of a restaurant you already like, as well as what location/type of cuisine you'd like a recommendation for.
